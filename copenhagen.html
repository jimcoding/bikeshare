            <p>The Copenhagen City Bikes was the city's first bike sharing system  that was implemented in 1995.  It had features such as (refundable) coin deposit, fixed stands, and specifically designed bicycles with parts that cannot be used on regular bicycles. Due to budget constraints to upgrade the system, the city terminated the system.  However in 2014, the Bycyklen bike sharing system was launched and marketed as the world's first smart bike.  It boasted innovations such as a touch screen tablet with a GPS routing system and puncture-free tires. The bike share's purpose was the provide a way for riders in Copenhagen to use the bicycles in tandem with mass transit for their daily commute.
