            <br>
            <p>Over the past 20 years, China has experienced a steady decline in bicycle use due to economic growth, the rise of car ownership, and the continuing degradation of the cycling environment. To address the growing traffic congestion and environmental concerns, China’s central and local government for urban
            transportation created Public Transit Priority to encourage public transport initiatives. As part of this effort, the Hangzhou city government launched Public Bicycle in 2008, the first information-technology-based public bikesharing prgram in China.</p>
            
            <p> Compared to other large-scale bike sharing programs, Hangzhou has experienced minimal bike theft or vandalism because the system utilizes low-cost bikes and cameras at each docking station.  90% of the total trips are made free of charge.  88% of users are local residents while the rest are tourists.  Local residents use the bike share instead of their own bicycles because of maintenance concerns and the fear of theft.  Furthermore, bikesharing supports one-way trips and intermodal transfers that cannot be supported by the usage of personal bicycles.<!--http://www.tsrc.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/China's%20Hangzhou%20Public%20Bicycle%20(article)%20-%20Shaheen.pdf --></p>

					<li>Broken Bridge and Su Di Causeway 断桥与苏堤:  Starting with Hangzhou's leading attraction at West Lake, this 5.4 km route travels across the renowned Broken Bridge, onto Gushan Island, where you can visit museums, nature trails, and the famous Louwailou restaurant, which specializes in Hangzhou cuisine. Then ride toward Su Di Causeway, where you will ride across West Lake through a peaceful tree-lined path.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Hidden West Lake 神秘西湖: If you want to enjoy West Lake's quietest and forested area, you should ride off the main road of Yanggong Di from the South end and go through the hidden paths, imperial tombs and temples, and neatly-maintained gardens. At the north end of Yanggong Di, continue north onto Shugang Lu and try some of the local cafes, bars, and exeptional restaurants. Lastly, park your bike at a bike station near Yellow Dragon Stadium and walk to explore various international cuisines such as Thai, French, Spanish, and Mexican on Baishaquan Alley.</li>
                    <br>
					<li>Quyuan Fenghe to Temple of Soul's Retreat 曲院风荷到灵隐寺:  From West Lake's northwest corner, ride west down Lingyin Lu towards Lingyin Si, one of China's largest Buddhist temples.  Continuing on this road, go uphill to get to arguably the most well-maintained Buddhist temple in China with an impressive 20-meter, gold-plated Siddhartha Guatama Buddha. Also don't miss out on Hangzhou Botanical Park if you go off Lingyin Lu.</li>
