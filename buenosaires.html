            <br>
            <p>Under the administration of Mayor Mauricio Macri, the Sustainable Mobility Plan ("Plan de Movilidad Sustentable" in Spanish) was formulated to reorgainze traffic in an efficient manner so that Buenos Aires residents can access different modes of well-organized transport systems and have a low impact on the environment.  It emphasized the use of non-motorized transport, such as bicycles, to decrease congestion, reduce accidents, and discourage car use.  One of the strategies was to develop Ecobici, a bike share system with dedicated cycleways.  The "Sistema de Transporte Publico de Bicileta" law ("Public Bicycle Transportation System") that was was passed in 2007, along with the Sustainable Mobility Plan that came afterwards, paved the way for the start of the bike sharing program called "Mejor en Bici" ("Better by Bike") by December 2010.</p>
            
            <p>By the end of 2012, two years after the inauguation of the cycling program, the share of cycling increased from 0.4% to 2%. More than 135 km of protected bike lanes have been added to Buenos Aires since inauguration.

                <br>
                <li>By 2015, biking represents more than 3.5% of all trips in the city. That is equivalent to more than 180,000 people biking every day as their main mode of transportation or to complement other alternatives such as subway, train, or buses.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When Ecobici first opened to the public in 2010, it offered just three stations and 72 bicycles, all operated out of manual stations.  Since then, the system has expanded to 32 stations with 850 bikes.  The system's expansion will eventually feature 200 automated stations, 24-hour service, and 3,000 bicycles when completed.
